			<p>It is with a sense of honour, pride and privilege that I am penning these few words to introduce the world of Ambedkar Institute of Technology a Delhi Government college affiliated to Directorate of Training & Technical Education. Over the past twelve years, we passed many milestones, logged in numerous achievements, created image for delivery of superior engineers and carved out a niche in corporate as well as academic arena for ourselves. All the while, the focus has remained on engineering education preparing capable aspiring young men and women for rewarding careers. Our quest for excellence over the years has built up the state of the art infrastructure and equipment, made more efficient by the most dedicated and experienced members of the faculty. While we endeavor to provide these inputs, students learn a lot more through their own interaction with peers, alumini and through actual work experience during summer placements with industry. I am delighted to say that many of our former students are now holding enviable positions in premier organizations in the country and abroad. They are a live testimony to the devotion, determination, and diligence that have been the hallmark of the Ambedkar Institute of Technology. I am sure that our students will be assetes for any company. I look forward to their bright future.<p>
